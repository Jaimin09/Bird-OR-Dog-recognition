# Bird-Dog-recognition
Model classify Bird or Dog from the given image
# Use
This model can be used for any binary image classification, by changing the dataset, and retraining it.
# Files:
- bird-OR-dog recongnition with NUMPY : is a binary classification model of image recognition made with numpy.
This model uses gradient descent algorithm, to classify images.

- bird-OR-dog recongnition with KERAS : is a binary classification model of image recognition made with keras.
This model uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). You will see performance difference at the end of the file.
 
- data_1000 is data set which contains X (input-type) of 1000 different images of bird and dog in csv format
- label_1000 is its corresponding labels, 0 or 1.
- test_data and test_label are for test_set
